    title: "3. Break of structure needs a retest",
    body: "A structure break alone isn't enough. Gobulu waits for price to retest the broken level before treating the shift as valid, no reacting to the first wick.",

    title: "5. Entry needs a reversal candle, always",

    title: "6. Fibonacci retracement adds another layer",
    body: "Gobulu measures the most recent swing on your entry timeframe and checks whether price is sitting at the 50.0% or 61.8% retracement, the two levels that count toward your score. Other levels are shown for reference only.",

  {
    title: "7. Confluence score gates the alarm",
    body: "Every factor above is one point, out of 8. Below 4 is Weak and stays silent. 4 is the minimum to alert (Good); 5–6 is Strong; 7–8 is Very Strong.",

    title: "9. Upload your own chart screenshots (optional)",
    body: "For each timeframe your cascade needs, you can upload a landscape screenshot straight from your phone or broker platform. An AI vision read gives you a second opinion, trend, visible structure, and any obvious candlestick, alongside the live cascade above.",
